Hi,
<p>
    I am a professional web developer with 8 years experience in Ruby on Rails & Javascript.
    Since 2016, I'm in love with developing using Rails as Backend and React.js as Frontend Toolchain.
</p>
<p>
    I post about things I stumble across during development and share new findings to give back to the community.
